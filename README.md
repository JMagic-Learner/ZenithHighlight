## Description
Hello, my name is Jason Ma. This application is called Zenith Highlight.

Zenith Highlight is a personal hobby website. I hope that I can expand the functionality of this website to host wargaming events and user-generated content.
              
Description:
This web application will display hobby works in progress, galleries, and host articles via MERN stack.             
          
Coding Process
The very first thing we have to do is to generate a foundation. This foundation is derived from the server file, which details the models, data, queries, mutatations etc. After generating the base structure of our server database, we then build a front end REACT application. This react application is denoted by the "Client" folder. The front end UI utilizes MATERIAL-UI / MUI

Application Layout:

1.) CLIENT
---> BUILD
- The folder where the npm run build outputs the final production
---> NODE_MODULES
- Node_Modules pertaining to the front-end portion of the MERN stack application
---> PUBLIC
- Default REACT 
---> ASSETS
- Contains components, assets, and all the "core" of the front-end UI
2.) NODE MODULES
3.) SERVER
---> CONFIG
- Describes where to connect, based on LOCAL or HEROKU
---> MODELS
- Describes the models, their traits, and sub-categories
---> NODE_MODULES
- Node_Modules pertaining to the back-end portion of the MERN stack 
---> SCHEMAS
- Details the queries, relationships between models
---> SEEDERS
- JSON data that can be used to seed the database. 
---> UTILS
- AUTH and Dateformat folders
